# Outgoing

ESP32 wifi module that takes data from a sensor and sends it to a server in Golang for multithread API handling.

## Libraries

1. Visit https://docs.espressif.com/projects/arduino-esp32/en/latest/installing.html for ESP32 library to download from the official repo (https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32.git) to your machine's Arduino IDE include libraries.

2. Once you clone the repo into the target directory (usually, C:/Users/YOUR_USERNAME/Documents/Arduino), go to `hardware/expressif/esp32/tools` and doblue click `get.exe`. When the file finishes a few downloads, it will close itself.

## Drivers

1. Look at the ESP32 module to see which chip it has. For example, mine has written "SILABS CP2102":

![img](res/module.jpg)

This means we need to use the Silicon Labs CP2102 USB-to-UART Bridge Controller driver ("cp2102 driver in google") provide USB connectivity while communicating via a simple serial protocol, which basically allows the PC to recognize the module and communicate with it through a USB cable.

- To install it, go to https://www.silabs.com/developers/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers and click on `CP210x Universal Windows Driver` option to download a zip file.

- Unzip the file to a temporary folder, right click on the file `silabser.inf` and choose Install. This is all you need to do.

2. Connect the module through a micro-USB cable.

3. Open the Arduino IDE.

4. Go to `Tools > Board` and look at the following:

![img](res/1.png)

- We choose `ESP32 Dev Module` option because the ESP32 module we have, on the back, it reads "ESP32 DEVKITV1", as seen below.

![img](res/2.jpg)

5. Click on Load to the code below to see if the computer is able to communicate with the module:

```c++
// this will make the board blink
void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  pinMode(2, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:
  digitalWrite(2, HIGH);
  delay(1000);
  digitalWrite(2, LOW);
  delay(1000);
}
```

*If everything is ok, a led will start blinking in the ESP32 module.*

## Send Sensor Data To Serial Monitor

1. We will use a DHT11 sensor to get the temperature and display it on the serial monitor first.

2. Wire the sensor to the ESP32 module using female-female dupont cables. The DHT11 sensor looks like this:

![img](res/5.jpg)

*Note: in the sensor, the "S" marks the spot where signal (3V3) should go, and it can change depending on the DHT11 sensor you have.*

The ESP32 module looks like below.

![img](res/6.jpg)

3. To make the code more readable, we handle the DHT11 data with a built-in Arduino Library called "DHT sensor library", which you need to include in your project. To do that, go to `Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries`, which will open a Library Manager.

![img](res/8.png)

4. In the Library Manager's search field, type "dht" and look for "DHT sensor library". Click on Install.

![img](res/7.png)

5. Now, load the following code to the ESP32:

```c++
// code that prints temperature on serial monitor
#include "DHT.h"
#define DHTPIN 2
#define DHTTYPE DHT11
DHT dht(DHTPIN, DHTTYPE);

void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  Serial.begin(9600);
  Serial.println("DHT11 output:");
  dht.begin();
}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:
  float temp = dht.readTemperature();
  if (isnan(temp)) {
    Serial.println("No data");
  }else{
    Serial.print("Temperature: ");
    Serial.print(temp);
    Serial.println("Â°C");
    delay(1000);
  }
  
}
```

And you will see the output in the Serial Monitor (9600):

## Server

- Install Gin Web Framework:

```
$ go get github.com/gin-gonic/gin
```

- To start the server, open terminal #1 and type:

```
$ export GO111MODULE=off
$ go run server.go
```

It will run the server on http://localhost:8080/

- To test sensor data is received (23 degrees), open terminal #2 on any folder, and type:

```
$ curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/dht?temp=23
```

Where the server side (terminal #2) would look as follows:

![img](res/server-sidev1.png)

And the client side (terminal #2) would look like below:

![img](res/client-sidev1.png)

*Note: as seen in terminal #1, the server is running on http://localhost:8080/ or http://127.0.0.1:8080/*

## Build Server Portable Executable

- Open a terminal where server.go is, and type:

```
go build
```

And you will have an executable, which you can run by:

```
$ ./server
```

The command compiles all `.go` files in the current directory. It will also create all the code necessary to be able to execute the binary in computers with **the same system architecture**, even if these future computers do not have the source `.go` files or Go installed.

- In this case, the development of the server was done in Linux Ubuntu 20.04 64-bit.

## Compile and Install Server Executable

- Open a terminal where server executable is, and type:

```
$ go install
$ server
```
